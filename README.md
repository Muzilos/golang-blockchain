## The Importance of BlockChain
### The Current State of Decentralization
Throughout history, many have attempted to materialize the utopian ideal of decentralization. Attempts to implement these ideals have always faced one critical issue: the ease at which a decentralized system can be infiltrated and collapse from any attempts to split any unions from it that may emerge.

Modern solutions to this fundamental issue have always required some sort of centralization of authority, a single source of truth from which smaller subsets of tightly governed authorities control and secure the data which they treat as Capital from which their wealth grows.

The Greek political philosophy of Democracy is one such example of a theoretical decentralized system in which every individual person has a say in the going ons of the larger whole of their society. The compromise between decentalization and authoritarianism that emerges from the material implementation of this ideal is the great American experiment of Democratic-Republicanism in which regional representatives are elected as single-source authorities of the needs and going-ons of their constituents, while still maintaining the veneer of decentralization and Democracy.

### The Future State of Decentralization
BlockChain is a material implementation of a truly decentralized system that can maintain a single-source of truth without succumbing to the threat that disinfomation has had on previous implementations of this theoretical framework. The propagation of this general ledger of information, and it can be of just about any sort of information, is now owned and propagated collectively by all those who participate in its creation and propagation.

The ownership of Capital is no longer just limited to the ownership of just land, utilities, raw materials, etc. it now also includes the very processing units found in the phones and computers of everyday working people. Within the pockets and homes of an ever-growing plurality of the global population is now the very means of their own production, independent of any central authority.

## How Blockchain works
### The Strucure of the Blockchain
The Blockchain keeps itself in check by essentially maintaining a backwards-linked list of "blocks" that store three quintessential properties: encrypted information, a unique identifying hash, and a link to the unique identifying hash of the previous block.  

The hash of each individual block is not only determined by the data stored in it, but also by the hash of the block that came before it. That means, that if ten people have one copy of a blockchain and one malicious actor decided to modify the data in a certain block of the chain and send it out, the hash of the modified block alongside every following block will not match the truth maintained in everyone else's blockchain and will be consequently rejected.

### "Proof of Work"
An algorithm that verifies that the blockchain is still intact, i.e. the data continues to be truthful. Running the proof of work powers the whole Blockchain network, as well as creating new blocks. The fundamental theory driving proof of work is that the work itself should be relatively hard to do, but proving the validity of the work should be relatively easy to do. This basically boils down to a P vs NP problem.

A popular example of proof of work is in the case of Bitcoin "miners" who take on the task of traversing the Blockchain and verifying any additions to the Blockchain. The reward for performing the proof of work in this case is a nice chunk of Bitcoin that is charged to users as a "mining fee" on top of all transactions.
